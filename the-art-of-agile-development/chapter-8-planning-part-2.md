# Chapter 8: Planning (part 2)

## Iteration Planning

### Takeaways:

* We stop at predetermined, unchangeable time intervals and compare reality to plan.
* Iterations are the heartbeat of an XP project.
* Although the iteration timebox doesnâ€™t prevent problems, it reveals them, which gives you the opportunity to correct the situation.
* Iteration schedule:
  - Demonstrate previous iteration (up to half an hour)
  - Hold retrospective on previous iteration (one hour) 
  - Plan iteration (half an hour to four hours)
  - Commit to delivering stories (five minutes) Develop stories (remainder of iteration)
  - Prepare release (less than 10 minutes)
