# Chapter 8: Planning (part 2)

## Iteration Planning

### Takeaways:

* We stop at predetermined, unchangeable time intervals and compare reality to plan.
* Iterations are the heartbeat of an XP project.
* Although the iteration timebox doesn’t prevent problems, it reveals them, which gives you the opportunity to correct the situation.
* Iteration schedule:
  - Demonstrate previous iteration (up to half an hour)
  - Hold retrospective on previous iteration (one hour) 
  - Plan iteration (half an hour to four hours)
    * Start by measuring the velocity of the previous iteration.
    * With your velocity in hand, you can select the stories to work on this iteration.
    * Because the iteration planning meeting takes stories from the front of the release plan, you should have already estimated and prioritized those stories.
    * After you have chosen the stories for the iteration, everybody but the programmers can leave the meeting, although anybody is welcome to stay if she likes.
    * At this point, the real work of iteration planning begins. Start by breaking down the stories into engineering tasks.
    * Brainstorming tasks is a design activity. If everybody has the same ideas about how to develop the software, it should go fairly quickly. If not, it’s a great opportunity for discussion before coding begins.
    * Finish brainstorming before you start estimating.
    * Call out the estimates as you finish them. If you hear somebody call out an estimate you disagree with, stop to discuss it and come to consensus.
    * Estimate the tasks in ideal hours.
    * As a final check, add up the estimates and compare them to the total task estimates from your previous iteration.
    * Discuss the situation with your on-site customers...adjust the plan until the team is ready to commit to delivering its stories.


  - Commit to delivering stories (five minutes) Develop stories (remainder of iteration)
  - Prepare release (less than 10 minutes)
