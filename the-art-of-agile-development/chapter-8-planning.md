#Chapter 8: Planning#

##Vision##

###Takeaways:###

1. The vision should be documented and updated as it evolves.
⋅⋅* The vision statement documents three things: _what_ the project should accomplish, _why_ it is valuable, and the project’s _success criteria_.
2. The vision should be visible and often referred back to or referenced.
⋅⋅* The vision should be posted prominently in the team’s informative workspace. 
⋅⋅* It should be used to “evangelize” the product to stakeholders and to explain the priority hierarchy of stories.
⋅⋅* Visionaries should be included in product decisions.

###Talking Points/Questions:###

* Does everyone know our vision for Learn?
* Should we include the vision at the top of every Product Spec? We have a loose version of this with problem statements and goals.
* Is our vision too vague to be used in this way?

##Release Planning##

###Takeaways:###

1. Work on one project at a time.
⋅⋅*Task-switching is costly.
⋅⋅*You can deliver value faster by shipping a project that is “yielding $$$” while the next project is in development, as opposed to working on the, in tandem and shipping them at the same time.
2. Release early and often.
⋅⋅*Include less in each release with a minimum marketable feature.
⋅⋅*The key to frequent releases is to decrease the real or perceived costs of upgrading.
⋅⋅*To increase the value of your software, create opportunities to learn.
⋅⋅*Build your plan so that each story stands alone, so you have the ability to release at any time.
3. Timeboxed plans are almost always better than scopeboxed plans. 
⋅⋅*A timeboxed plan defines the release date in advance, but the specific features that release will include are uncertain (scopeboxed is the opposite).
⋅⋅*Timeboxed plans constrain the amount of work you can do and force the team to make difficult but important prioritization decisions.
4. Plan at the last responsible moment.
⋅⋅*Not having to adapt the plan constantly will reduce wasted time.
⋅⋅*Your planning horizon determines how far you look into the future.
⋅⋅*Use a tiered set of planning horizons.
⋅⋅⋅⋅*General plan = long planning horizon
⋅⋅⋅⋅*Specific, detailed plan = short planning horizon

###Talking Points/Questions:###

* How can we structure our team to be able to work on one project at a time?
* At what team size does this become inefficient?
* How can we better structure our projects to release early, but not incur costs by shipping a degraded product experience for our users?
* This book often uses revenue as a marker for the success of a project, but Flatiron’s revenue is related to many components, and not every project has a direct impact on revenue. How can we measure success?
* What if the cost of a release is the training/re-training of a subset of users? 
* Doing adaptive planning under the radar - thoughts?
* Planning at the last responsible moment means we can’t show exactly what we’ll deliver. Doesn’t that require too much trust from stakeholders?

##The Planning Game##

###Takeaways:###

1. The planning game is a structured approach to creating the best possible plan given the information available.
⋅⋅*Programmers estimate because they have the most information regarding cost.
⋅⋅*Customers prioritize because they have the most information regarding value.
⋅⋅*Every decision to do something is a decision to not do something else.
⋅⋅*Neither group creates the plan unilaterally.
⋅⋅*Each group has final say over its area of expertise. 
⋅⋅*The result is a plan: a single list of stories in priority order.
⋅⋅*Index cards are important to use because they demonstrate the amount of work to be done in a visible way and focus disagreements away from individuals.
2. With customers and programmers working directly together, the miracle of collaboration occurs.
⋅⋅*Customers want to ship a solid, usable product, and will have to balance that desire with the desire to meet crucial market windows.
⋅⋅*When the customers ask for an explanation of an estimate, don’t describe the technical options. Instead, interpret the technology and describe the options in terms of business impact.
⋅⋅*Relies on many of XP’s simplifying assumptions, and may not work for every team or project.
⋅⋅*The planning game assumes that the team has a single dominant constraint (programmers).

###Talking Points/Questions:###

* Every project has a fixed amount of disappointment associated with it.
* How can we do a planning exercise with remote teammates that has the same physical impact as index cards?
* How can we ensure that our customers are as knowledgeable about the planning process as we will be after reading this book? 
* Single dominant constraint = how quickly programmers program. Is this the only constraint on our team? What about the constraint of training many part-time and/or distributed end users? 

##Risk Management##

###Takeaways:###

1. Despite life’s curveballs, risk management allows your team to make and meet the schedule commitments upon which stakeholders rely.
2. When estimating, use the provided _generic risk multipliers_ to account for the normal risks of a project.
3. Create a _risk census_ to manage risks that are project-specific.
⋅⋅*Brainstorming potential catastrophes (thinking negatively is necessary).
⋅⋅*Brainstorm scenarios that could lead to those catastrophes.
⋅⋅*From those scenarios imagine possible root causes.
⋅⋅*These root causes are your risks.
⋅⋅*For each risk determine the estimated probability and specific impact (discard unimportant risks).
⋅⋅*Decide what action to take. Avoid, contain, mitigate, or ignore (irresponsible).
⋅⋅*Update release plan to account for risks.
4. For the risks you decided to handle determine the following:
⋅⋅*Transition indicators: tell you when the risk will come true.	
⋅⋅*Mitigation activities: reduce the impact of the risk in advance.
⋅⋅*Contingency activities: reduce the impact of the risk if it occurs.
⋅⋅*Risk exposure: how much time/money to set aside to contain the risk.

###Talking Points/Questions:###

* When does this multiplying take place? Does the product manager do this with the estimates provided by engineers? Are the engineers already doing this risk management with their numbers?
* Feels like we would use the “Risky” column in the generic risk multiplier chart.
* Risk Management needs to have organizational buy in.
