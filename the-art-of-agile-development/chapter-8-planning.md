# Chapter 8: Planning

## Vision

## Takeaways:

1. The vision should be documented and updated as it evolves.
  * The vision statement documents three things: _what_ the project should accomplish, _why_ it is valuable, and the project’s _success criteria_.
2. The vision should be visible and often referred back to or referenced.
  * The vision should be posted prominently in the team’s informative workspace. 
  * It should be used to “evangelize” the product to stakeholders and to explain the priority hierarchy of stories.
  * Visionaries should be included in product decisions.

## Talking Points/Questions:

* Does everyone know our vision for Learn?
* Should we include the vision at the top of every Product Spec? We have a loose version of this with problem statements and goals.
* Is our vision too vague to be used in this way?

## Release Planning

### Takeaways:

1. Work on one project at a time.
  * Task-switching is costly.
  * You can deliver value faster by shipping a project that is “yielding $$$” while the next project is in development, as opposed to working on the, in tandem and shipping them at the same time.
2. Release early and often.
  * Include less in each release with a minimum marketable feature.
  * The key to frequent releases is to decrease the real or perceived costs of upgrading.
  * To increase the value of your software, create opportunities to learn.
  * Build your plan so that each story stands alone, so you have the ability to release at any time.
3. Timeboxed plans are almost always better than scopeboxed plans. 
  * A timeboxed plan defines the release date in advance, but the specific features that release will include are uncertain (scopeboxed is the opposite).
  * Timeboxed plans constrain the amount of work you can do and force the team to make difficult but important prioritization decisions.
4. Plan at the last responsible moment.
  * Not having to adapt the plan constantly will reduce wasted time.
  * Your planning horizon determines how far you look into the future.
  * Use a tiered set of planning horizons.
    * General plan = long planning horizon
    * Specific, detailed plan = short planning horizon

### Talking Points/Questions:

* How can we structure our team to be able to work on one project at a time?
* At what team size does this become inefficient?
* How can we better structure our projects to release early, but not incur costs by shipping a degraded product experience for our users?
* This book often uses revenue as a marker for the success of a project, but Flatiron’s revenue is related to many components, and not every project has a direct impact on revenue. How can we measure success?
* What if the cost of a release is the training/re-training of a subset of users? 
* Doing adaptive planning under the radar - thoughts?
* Planning at the last responsible moment means we can’t show exactly what we’ll deliver. Doesn’t that require too much trust from stakeholders?

## The Planning Game

### Takeaways:

1. The planning game is a structured approach to creating the best possible plan given the information available.
  * Programmers estimate because they have the most information regarding cost.
  * Customers prioritize because they have the most information regarding value.
  * Every decision to do something is a decision to not do something else.
  * Neither group creates the plan unilaterally.
  * Each group has final say over its area of expertise. 
  * The result is a plan: a single list of stories in priority order.
  * Index cards are important to use because they demonstrate the amount of work to be done in a visible way and focus disagreements away from individuals.
2. With customers and programmers working directly together, the miracle of collaboration occurs.
  * Customers want to ship a solid, usable product, and will have to balance that desire with the desire to meet crucial market windows.
  * When the customers ask for an explanation of an estimate, don’t describe the technical options. Instead, interpret the technology and describe the options in terms of business impact.
  * Relies on many of XP’s simplifying assumptions, and may not work for every team or project.
  * The planning game assumes that the team has a single dominant constraint (programmers).

## Talking Points/Questions:

* Every project has a fixed amount of disappointment associated with it.
* How can we do a planning exercise with remote teammates that has the same physical impact as index cards?
* How can we ensure that our customers are as knowledgeable about the planning process as we will be after reading this book? 
* Single dominant constraint = how quickly programmers program. Is this the only constraint on our team? What about the constraint of training many part-time and/or distributed end users? 

## Risk Management

### Takeaways:

1. Despite life’s curveballs, risk management allows your team to make and meet the schedule commitments upon which stakeholders rely.
2. When estimating, use the provided _generic risk multipliers_ to account for the normal risks of a project.
3. Create a _risk census_ to manage risks that are project-specific.
  * Brainstorming potential catastrophes (thinking negatively is necessary).
  * Brainstorm scenarios that could lead to those catastrophes.
  * From those scenarios imagine possible root causes.
  * These root causes are your risks.
  * For each risk determine the estimated probability and specific impact (discard unimportant risks).
  * Decide what action to take. Avoid, contain, mitigate, or ignore (irresponsible).
  * Update release plan to account for risks.
4. For the risks you decided to handle determine the following:
  * Transition indicators: tell you when the risk will come true.	
  * Mitigation activities: reduce the impact of the risk in advance.
  * Contingency activities: reduce the impact of the risk if it occurs.
  * Risk exposure: how much time/money to set aside to contain the risk.

## Talking Points/Questions:

* When does this multiplying take place? Does the product manager do this with the estimates provided by engineers? Are the engineers already doing this risk management with their numbers?
* Feels like we would use the “Risky” column in the generic risk multiplier chart.
* Risk Management needs to have organizational buy in.
