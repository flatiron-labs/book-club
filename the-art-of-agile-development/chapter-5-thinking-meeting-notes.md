_This is a framework, but it should not override your intuition._

## Pairing
* It's good for the most part, but pair programming can get exhausting.
*  Ping-Pong pairing is good, if the two people are on the same page and can easily switch driver/navigator a lot.
* Is it productive to switch a lot? It's a muscle to context switch, and you get better over time.
* It's cool to play to your pair's individual strengths.
* How much context do we want to switch when we switch pairs? It could be as granular as a ticket but going up to a project could be tough. Is it valuable for us to be able to context switch?
* "Pairs are fluid, shifting naturally": how do we avoid chaos? Our process already allows for people to grab each other based on what kind of work needs to be done. This is definitely made better when you know your teammates well enough to pick the right people to pair with.
* Pairing is made easier/better when we can scope and contextualize our tasks well. This requires strong communication between people working on the same thing.
* Pairing can be really effective when the pair sets a goal and knows in what direction they're going. When that direction is lost, when is it the right time to take a break from the pair to do some research? Maybe it's an opportunity to teach someone something.
* Just because you _should_ know something and have to debug, doesn't mean it's a waste of time for the other person.

## Retrospectives
* It's a place where you're invited to experiment with various things.
* It's cool that there's one goal the team has between retrospectives has to align to. That allows for focus.
* Index cards allow us to see the magnitude of problems, give people a chance to voice their opinion without having to speak to the whole group.
* There might be a flow between retrospectives, so you can reflect on your goal as you do the next retrospective.
* How do we divide tasks between large, full-team tasks and smaller, lower-hanging fruit?

## Root-Cause Analysis
* Be willing to ask the deeper questions.
* Make sure to focus on the stuff that's inside your control.

## Informative Workspace
* The book says don't game process improvement. Perhaps this means making better games so that people's behavior is closely coupled with the intended solution.
* Informative workspaces allow transparency without friction. People can get the info they need without bothering anyone.
* Push for things to be physical, but how does a remote team member interact with the boards? Maybe we can have a robot arm. What about duplication of tools, since a lot of things are tracked in github already? The goal is to ensure that people see the information as it exists in the space.
* Is having this kind of information worth the effort? It helps when that information is coupled with the institutional goals that the information supports. It'll help to have an ROI conversation about all of this.
* It helps to have an actual _single_ point of information about all of the things that we track.
* Look to Career Services to see what's a good granularity of information to put on the board.
* "Make it harder to make mistakes" by automating the board.
* Make sure you pick _one_ thing as the single source of truth, and everything lives there.

## Energized Work
* We're good at that.
