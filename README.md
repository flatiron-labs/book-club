# Labs Book Club

Each week, we meet to discuss some technical aspect of a chapter of a book or a blog post. To provide some structure around our discussion, we ask a member of the team to lead. 

The book club leader's responsibilities are the following:

1. Read the chapter
2. Take notes and/or come prepared with discussion questions
3. Book a room at HQ for discussion
4. Make sure there's a leader for the following week

You don't need to be an expert in the chapter to lead book club. Just bring your own curiosity and excitement. 

This repo holds our group notes for the books we've been reading. Notes aren't required, but they a) serve as a great jumping point for discussion and b) remind us of what we've learned.

## Adding Notes

Each book has its own directory. If you want to add notes for a given book, create a Markdown file in the directory and name it with the convention `"#{ chapter/section number }-#{ subject summary }.md`.

Please use integers and dots to describe the chapter (like a software version number) to keep notes alphabetized sequentially alongside the book. For example, `3.1-collecting-inputs.md`. Also, a lot of technical books are already organized like this!
