# Labs Bookclub

We read good and wanna learn to do other stuff good too. Like coding. So we started a book club!

This repo holds our group notes for the books we've been reading.

## Adding Notes

Each book has its own directory. If you want to add notes for a given book, create a Markdown file in the directory and name it with the convention `"#{ chapter/section number }-#{ subject summary }.md`.

Please use integers and dots to describe the chapter (like a software version number) to keep notes alphabetized sequentially alongside the book. For example, `3.1-collecting-inputs.md`. Also, a lot of technical books are already organized like this!
