# Site Reliability Engineering

## 18. Software Engineering in SRE

- SREs adopt a product-based mindset w internal customers & roadmap > one-off solutions & quick hacks
- related to overall directive of maintaining uptime and keeping latency low, but can take many forms
  - rollout mechanisms
  - monitoring
  - development environments built on dynamic server compositions


### Why is software engineering within SRE important?

- breadth & depth of Google production experience at massive scale allows expertise in developing with scalability, graceful degradation during failure, & ability to easily interface with other infrastructure or tools
- strong feedback loop as fellow SREs are target users
- guiding principle: *"team size should not scale directly with service growth"*
  - achieving linear team growth w exponential service growth requires perpetual automation work and efforts to streamline tools & processes
- provide career development opportunities for SREs
- balances interrupts & on call work


### Auxon Case Study

- tool to automate capacity planning

###### Traditional Capacity Planning

1. Collect demand forecasts.
2. Devise build and allocation plans
3. Review & sign off plan
4. Deploy & configure resources

- Brittle by nature. Can be disrupted by any change. Laborious and imprecise.
- Humans are terrible at binpacking and finding optimal solution

###### Intent-based Capacity Planning & Auxon

- Reverse engineer back from the concrete requirements to the driving reason why.
    - I want 50 cores in clusters X, Y, and Z for service Foo.
    - I want a 50-core footprint in any 3 clusters in geographic region YYY for service Foo.
    - I want to meet service Foo’s demand in each geographic region, and have N + 2 redundancy.
    - I want to run service Foo at 5 nines of reliability.
- Dependencies and their requirements make everything even more complex
- Auxon collects intent-based descriptions of resource requirements & prioritizations and formulates an allocation plan
- SRE team is both the producer and consumer of their software. Real world production experience and difficulties (spreadsheets) helped guide the product

- Don’t focus on perfection and purity of solution, especially if the bounds of the problem aren’t well known. Launch and iterate.
- Initial Auxon solver was a "Stupid Solver", a very unoptimized version to validate the vision. Start there.
- Undertake initial "approximate" work with eye for the future. May be naive implemenation today, but create a pathway to enhancements and changes.
- Fuzzy requirements (integrations with other rapidly changing automation tooling) requires building the software with a large degree of flexibility. Built Auxon to be tool agnostic for integrations.

#### Raise Awareness and Driving Adoption

- large effort to drive awareness and adoption
- consistent and coherent approach
- user advocacy
- sponsorship of senior engineers and management after demonstrating value

#### Set expecatations

- easy to imagine utopian end state of product. instead, focus on *minimum success criteria*
- projects lose credibility by promising too much. demonstrate steady, incremental progress increases confidence in your team's ability to deliver useful software

#### Identify appropriate customers

- targeted teams with *no* capacity planning tools. most open to adoption and feels the pain.
- early success turns customers to advocates for the tool
- developed case studies & demonstrated time savings

#### Customer service

- provide white glove service in the beginning
- assuage fears, change is scary.
- demonstrate reduction of toil and greater ownership by the team

### Designing at the right level

- *agnosticism* - write software to be generalized. customers not required to commit to any specific tool to start using the Auxon framework.
- 100% adoption doesn't need to be the goal, every use case is different.

### Team Dynamics

- Seed team with generalists who can get up to speed quickly w engineers w breadth of knowledge and experience.
- Partner w in house experts (or outsourced & consultants) once project is off the ground

### Fostering Software Engineering in SRE

- How to pick a project to go from one off tool to full fledged project?
  - engineers w first hand experience in the domain
  - target user base that's highly technical and can provide strong signal bug reports
  - noticeable benefits such as reducing toil for SREs, improving infrastructure, or streamlining a complex process.
- poor candidates:
  - touches many moving parts
  - all or nothing approach (no iterative design)
  - overly specific and not generalizable to the whole org
 
### Successfully building software engineering culture in SRE: Staffing & Development Time

- SREs are often generalists, but often not part of product team or think about customer facing requests
- partner w engineers, TPMs, & PMs with user facing experience
- *dedicated, noninterrupted, project work time is essential*
- end results:
  - grass root effort in spare time
  - formal project through structured process
  - executive sponsorship to expand into full software development effort
- important SREs continue to work with whole org to remain in touch with production


## 28. Accelerating SREs to On-Call and Beyond

### How to grow SREs / Proper Training

#### Recommended
- Designing concrete, sequential learning experiences for students to follow
- Encouraging reverse engineering, statistical thinking, and working from fundamental principles
- Celebrating the analysis of failure by suggesting postmortems for students to read
- Creating contained but realistic breakages for students to fix using real monitoring and tooling
- Role-playing theoretical disasters as a group, to intermingle a team’s problem-solving approaches
- Enabling students to shadow their on-call rotation early, comparing notes with the on-caller
- Pairing students with expert SREs to revise targeted sections of the on-call training plan
- Carving out nontrivial project work for students to undertake, allowing them to gain partial ownership in the stack

#### Anti Patterns
- Deluging students with menial work (e.g., alert/ticket triage) to train them; "trial by fire"
- Training strictly through operator procedures, checklists, and playbooks
- Treating outages as secrets to be buried in order to avoid blame
- Having the first chance to fix something only occur after a student is already on-call
- Creating experts on the team whose techniques and knowledge are compartmentalized
- Pushing students into being primary on-call before they achieve a holistic understanding of their service
- Treating on-call training plans as static and untouchable except by subject matter experts
- Awarding all new project work to the most senior SREs, leaving junior SREs to pick up the scraps


- Training should focus on concepts, principles, reasoning, reverse engineering, and working from first principles instead of rote knowledge.

#### Targeted Project Work, Not Menial Work

- first project for junior SRE should take them through the whole stack.
- allow them to contribute and learn at the same time
- now has ownership going forward and builds trust with senior engineers

#### Creating Stellar Reverse Engineers and Improvisational Thinkers

- In the course of their jobs, they will come across systems they’ve never seen before, so they need to have strong reverse engineering skills.
  - teach diagnostic and debugging tools and how to draw inferences from the information this reveals.
- At scale, there will be anomalies that are hard to detect, so they’ll need the ability to think statistically, rather than procedurally, to uncloak problems
    - SRE's job is pruning a massive decision tree of how to react during an incident
    - Teach how to construct hypotheses that can be tested and narrow down the decision tree
- When standard operating procedures break down, they’ll need to be able to improvise fully.
  - ability to zoom out and use analytical thinking to find solutions

- Exercise: team takes over a service they have no familiarity with and reverse engineer it to run it


#### Five Practices for Aspiring On-Callers

1. A Hunger for Failure: Reading and Sharing Postmortems
2. Disaster Role Playing
3. Break Real Things, Fix Real Things
4. Documentation as Apprenticeship
5. Shadow On-Call Early and Often

- Do not dump postmortems on junior folks, postmortems are important and should be treated so.
- As SRE, you have to scale up your humans faster than you scale your machines
