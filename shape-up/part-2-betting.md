# Part 2: Betting

*context*: we just started a 6 week cycle working on this: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RGz7_xzeGtvjawU2uITAkjbpQ5lHtIOnR0Db-6qrrNM/edit?usp=sharing

## Bets, Not Backlogs

### no backlogs

* We have a pitch, now what?

* Backlogs pile up, get stale, are anxiety inducing, and require maintenance.

### a few potential bets

* Instead, before a 6-week cycle we have a betting table to review  a handful of pitches new or old that people are
willing to lobby for.

### decentralized lists

* People can still track stuff over time, just dont make it a giant centralized backlog.

* Anything that is discussed is important enough to have been remembered and advocated for by somebody.

### important ideas come back

* Ideas are cheap and there's a lot of them. Important ideas will resurface over time.

## Betting Table

### Six-week cycles

* Hard to manage a bunch of different looking schedules, much easier to use cycles of uniform length.

* 2-week sprints are generally too short to get something meaningful done and add a lot of planning overhead.

* 6 weeks is short enough to still feel deadline driven.

### Cool-down

* After a 6 week cycle, the squad is free to work on whatever they want for 2 weeks.

### Team and project sizes

* A project team consists of 1 designer and 1 or 2 programmers and then later a QA tester.

* Work on 1 project or multiple smaller projects, "big batch" and "small batch" teams.

* Small batch projects are 1-2 weeks and the delivery schedule within the 6 week cycle is up to the squad.

### The betting table

* meeting where stakeholders decide what to do

* no grooming or backlog, just a few good ideas

* basecamp's betting table is the CEO, CTO, a senior programmer, and a product strategist.

* C-level presence creates a "wast no time" approach

* There are ad-hoc one-on-one convos leading up to betting table

* Final output is a cycle plan which is what to do and who to schedule. No further approval is required to move foward.

* Gives upper management a stronger sense of control over the company. 

### meaning of a bet

* "betting" instead of "planning" because it sets diff expectations

* bets have a payout

* bets are commitments, betting team commits giving project team the entire 6 weeks to work exclusively on the project
with no interruptions

* caps the downside. worst case scenario we lose 6 weeks of work. 

### uninterrupted time

* we really dont want to interrupt the project team's time

* chipping a "few hours" or "a day" off of the project team for something else kills momentum and is actually way more
expensive than it seems, hours kill days and days kill weeks

* something new comes up? wait until the end of the cycle and bet on it for next cycle 

* hit the brakes for real crisis but real crises are rare.

### circuit breaker

* uninterrupted time comes with tough but powerful policy of no extensions. if it doesnt ship on time then it doesnt
ship at all.

* eliminates risk of runaway projects, appetite is in context of 6-weeks so longer doesnt work.

* circuit breakers keep system from overloading, metaphor is that a single project shouldnt overload the whole team

* missing deadline means something went wrong in shaping. instead of continuing to invest in bad approach, step back
and reframe problem and do better

* circuit breaker gives team more ownership over project. project teams have full responsibility for executing projects
which includes trade-offs in implementation and choosing where to cut scope. forces constant re-examination of what's
worth doing

### what about bugs?

* no interruptions, so what about bugs?

* question our assumptions about bugs

* nothing special about bugs that make them more important than other things
  - what if we feel that they make us look unprofessional or sloppy? other things dont always do that

* all software has bugs

* the question is: how severe are they? 

* real crisis: data being lost, app not working, lots of customers seeing wrong thing

* again, real crisis rare and bugs can wait 6+ weeks or never be fixed at all

* impossible to eliminate all bugs, would never be able to ship

* how to deal with bugs:
  - use cool down
  - bring it to the betting table if it's big
  - schedule a "bug smash" where everyone just sits around and fixes bug for some period of time

### keep the slate clean

* manage capacity by starting with a clean slate each cycle, never carry over work and impact cycle capacity

* always maximize your future options this way to allow for uncertain future of great ideas and urgent requests

* long-term roadmap should be kept to the side and used to inform each cycle betting

* what about projects that take more than 1 cycle? always plan the cycle in a way that allows you to change course

## place your bets

### look where you are

* always set different expectations based on context when betting to take into account current place on product
development arc

### existing products

* working on existing products defines space that new work will fit into with the pieces that wont change

### new products

* 3 phases of work on building new products from scratch
* foundations need to be figured out

#### r&d mode

* instead of betting on a well-shaped pitch we mainly bet the time on spiking some key pieces of the new product idea

* shaping is fuzzier because we learn by building

* a senior team does the building

* we dont expect to ship but we also dont commit to more than 1-cycle

* depending on how it goes decide whether to continue spending on r&d or deliver something

*note* - how does the current cycle relate to Basecamp's idea of r&d mode? 

#### production mode

* if r&d warms us up we go into production mode where the most important architectural decisions are sttled

* in production mode:
  - shaping is deliberate again
  - team no longer limited to senior group
  - shippping is the goal, not spiking

* keep the option open to cut features since we're still a bit experimental

#### cleanup mode

* right before shipping a brand new product, throw all structure out the window for cleanup mode

* cover things we forget, miss, wrong stuff, bugs from r&d and production mode

* getting ready to ship makes you more aware of what's wrong or important

* in this mode:
  - no shaping, more liek a bug smash
  - no clear team boundaries, everyone helps
  - work is shipped as continuously as possible

* leadership makes final cut decisions

### examples

* dot grid

* student profile app
