3.12 Reject unworkable values with preconditions
    - missing attributes and constantly checking for nil??
        - try checking for validity when it’s set
        - reject values upfront
3.13 Use #fetch to assert presence of Hash keys
    - raises KeyError instead of nil for a missing required key b/c nil and false can be handled the same way as they are both falsey
    - able to customize fetch w/ a block; supply a fallback method if the key is not found
3.14 Use #fetch for defaults
    - Same idea as asserting the presence, but instead only do the fallback action if the key isn’t present. logging example
    - more precise than using ||, less prone to errors when false values involved
    - block form: set to constant with = -> { }; then &CONSTANT is passed as a block
    - block form vs 2 argument form
        - when the default argument is passed to fetch it is always evaluated
3.15 Document assumptions with assertions
    - when working with 3rd party, check the inputs, even if it’s a check of a class
    - set up early warning systems; raise errors, coerce inputs into the types you want
3.16 Handle special cases with a guard clause
    - use early returns for special case instead of giving equal weight to edge case and body of method
3.17 Represent special cases as objects
    - ex. guest user object returned in place of db-backed user
    - common role in the inputs passed to numerous methods => user; translates not to no user, but to a special kind of anonymous user
    - what would it take to add this to learn? maybe do a code reading workshop
