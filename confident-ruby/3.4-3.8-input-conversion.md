## 3.4 Define your own conversion protocols

##### Use case:
- Input(s) need to be specific type of object (ex. array, hash, etc) AND represent specific context (ex. coordinates)

##### Implementation:
- mimic native Ruby protocols

##### Pros:
- methods are more extensible
- add more "meaning" to conversion call
- better self-documentation than native protocols

##### Questions:
- pg 54: `draw_line` method - why call `to_coords` then `to_ary`?


## 3.5 Define conversions to user-defined types

##### Use case:
- input is an object
- input needs to behave like an instance of a class you defined (non-native Class)
- often used with units of measure

##### Implementation:
- custom conversion protocol
- will be different case by case
- should be well-documented

##### Pros:
- when done well, method plays nice with any input, even 3rd party objects
- converting input to single, known type helps limit logic branches
- custom type gives more control, helps reduce unit mixups (ex. cm vs in, etc.)
- supports addition of new classes, as long as they use shared API

##### Cons:
- method is less extensible, since it's designed to act upon one specific object type
- some inputs can't be converted

##### Questions:
- altitude example: basically just shared API / `Meterable` concern?


## 3.6 Use built-in conversion functions

##### Use case:
- input is an object
- input needs to behave like an instance of a native Ruby class

##### Implementation:
- use Ruby "capitalized conversion functions" (ex. Integer, Array) provided by Kernel module
- https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.1/Kernel.html

##### Pros:
- reliably converts inputs that make sense
- prevents conversion of nonsense inputs (i.e. raises an error)
- built-in functions are more flexible, **work with more input types than `#to_*` methods**
- functions are _idempotent_ (aka smart about when to convert)
- maximum leeway for inputs w/ minimum effort

##### Cons:
- built-in functions are inconsistent? p64: "Note that built-in conversion functions aren't completely consistent in their operation. String(), for instance, simply calls #to_s on its argument."
- one weird case: no `Hash()`, only `Hash[]` (<--- only works when passed even number of arguments)

##### Questions:
- confusing? methods share names with core classes
- capitalized name suggests object, but these are actually functions
- functions interact with inputs; no `self` available


## 3.7 Use the Array() conversion function to array-ify inputs
^^ pretty much a subtype of 3.6

##### Use case:
- input is an object
- method requires an Array object
- method needs to be able to accept lotsa different types of input objects

##### Implementation:
- use built-in `Array()` function

##### Pros:
- ensures you'll be working with an array object
- works on nearly any kind of input (unusually flexible)

##### Cons:
- can make method too flexible (`Array()` handles almost any input w/o raising errors... when in some cases, might be more appropriate to raise error)

##### Questions:
- handles nil values; good to use whenever you need an Enumerable? (like Avdi recommends on p69)


## 3.8 Define conversion functions
^^ like 3.4, but with functions instead of protocols

##### Use case:
- need public API that accepts lotsa different input types
- behind the scenes, need to normalize input before acting on it
- need to normalize to single custom type (non-native type)

##### Implementation:
- write idempotent function that handles multiple input types gracefully (easier said than done)
- convert/reject input right away (at top of function)
- define in a module

##### Pros:
- concise, clean public interface
- encapsulate conversion in single reusuable module
- can handle lotsa input types

##### Cons:
- function is kinda one big case statement; is that always the case?

##### Questions:
- `module_function` is new: "This obscurely-named built-in method does two things: First, it marks all following methods as private. Second, it makes the methods available as singleton methods on the module."
- also new: using lambda `->(arg){...}` in case statements
