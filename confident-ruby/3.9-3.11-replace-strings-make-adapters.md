## 3.9 Replace "string typing" with classes

##### Use case:
  - You're using specially formulated Strings to handle control flow with a case statement 

##### Implementation:
  - split that out into classes, yo!
  - instead of strings (which can have all sorts of formatting issues), use user-defined types
  - cases that vary (e.g. change light AND ring bell on yellow light) can be handled with additional methods in the subclass


##### Pros:
  - clearly defined interface that doesn't require additional case checks with new states added
  - better error handling (Ruby lets you know if you call a class that doesn't exist)
  - much cleaner interface in the TrafficLight class
  - don't have to worry about guarding the borders in the subclasses, the parent class handled that


##### Questions:
  - How do you know when you've found the right abstraction?
    - make it work then make it right
      - avoid obsessing over the wrong things
    - find intermediary steps (e.g. use string once as constant then use constant)
    - keep the small methods flexible so later abstractions are easier
      - especially anything dealing with updates/changes...make the change in one place so modifications to those changes will only require one code update
  - How early should you put in an abstraction like this?  You go from two easy to read case statements to multiple classes and polymorphism.  Is the code more clear at this point?
    - don't create a new class until you're certain what that class interface should be
    - way harder to fix bad abstraction than underoptimized code


## 3.10 Wrap collaborators in Adapters

##### Use case:
  - You've got a wide arrange of input objects that don't have a common interface

##### Implementation:
  - create a wrapper that adapts the input object so that it has a common interface that you can use


##### Pros:
  - consistent interface across all of the input objects


##### Questions:
  - Should you always use a wrapper by default, just in case new inputs get added later?  Or is it better to wait until the first time you add a second set of inputs?
    - Best to wait until you have a better sense of what other inputs would be
      - hard to make an adapter off of only one input example
    - Easier if you have a super method (smaller methods that roll up into super)
      - if implementation changes, you can alter the details of the smaller methods
      - add an adapter when the method gets unreasonably hard to comprehend


## 3.11 Use transparent adapters to gradually introduce abstraction

##### Use case:
  - You want to use an adapter, but, you inherited legacy code that has pre-existing dependencies on custom methods all over the place.


##### Implementation:
  - create a wrapper that serves as a 'transparent adapter'.  Anything that has the right interface to be handled by the adapter will be.  Everything else is passed through to the underlying classes with the custom methods.


##### Pros:
  - Improve quality of code incrementally, you don't have to do a huge overhaul all at once
    - New stuff follows a better pattern
    - Old stuff can be transitioned as there is time (or necessity)

##### Questions:
  - danger in not following through
    - Adds a layer of indirection that's not useful if you don't fully end up changing things over
  - if you try to be too clever, you're going to get your ass kicked
    - if there's not a contract between the devs that this is a reasonable way to approach the problem, you're obfuscating understandability to everyone
