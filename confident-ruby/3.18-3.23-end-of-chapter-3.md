## 3.18 Represent do-nothing cases as null objects

##### Use case:

- you're expecting a nil input (potentially)
- nil input represents a `#NOOP` case

##### Implementation:

- Null Object collaborator object w/ same interface
- responds by taking no action

from Avi:
- decouple AR objects from plain Ruby objects
- namespace AR objects behind `DB::`
- then easier to use NullObject
- prevent lots of AR method missing errors
- easier testing

##### Pros:

- get rid of `nil?` checks
- useful for testing (dry runs, "quiet mode")

##### Cons:

- base NullObject that overrides method_missing... seems dangerous
- NullObject with infinite depth (p 156) seems SUPER dangerous
- not confident - more like "don't wanna see the error" kind of programming

##### Questions:

- could we use this for "quiet mode" in diff environments?
- instead, create good ways for your program to break. should break in predictable ways
- null objects make more sense in view layer. not as good when null object writes to db


## 3.19 Substitute a benign value for `nil`

##### Use case:

- expecting a non-essential input that could be `nil`

##### Implementation:

- convert nil to "known good" value
- use instead of if/else or case conditional

##### Pros:

- we use this pattern a lot already
- fewer surprises than NullObject

##### Cons:

- how to define "known good"?
- what about unknown unknown bads?
- should I be raising an error here instead?

##### Questions:

- do we like this better than NullObject? we do seem to use this pattern more in our codebase


## 3.20 Use symbols as placeholder objects

##### Use case:

- working with inputs that may or may not get called by other methods

##### Implementation:

- use symbol as a placeholder

##### Pros:

- meaningful, traceable errors
- prevent "find the nil" bug hunting

##### Cons:

- doesn't prevent errors... just enables slightly easier bug hunting

##### Questions:

- why not use a guard clause + custom error message instead?


## 3.21 Bundle arguments into parameter objects

##### Use case:

- multiple methods that accept same list of params

##### Implementation:

- identify these re-used params
- bundle them into their own class
- pass that class around instead

##### Pros:

- popular "Introduce Param Object" refactoring pattern
- reduce # of params
- makes code more readable / self-documenting

##### Cons:

- any? maybe just don't start abstracting too soon
- leads to clients needing to know about many different classes (see below)

##### Questions:

- let's do this more, yeah?


## 3.22 Yield a parameter builder object

##### Use case:

- you're bundling lotsa params into classes and passing those around

##### Implementation:

- create builder with shared interface
- yield to blocks inside builder for more flexibility

##### Pros:

- only builder has to know about subclasses / all your bundled param classes
- extensible, flexible

##### Cons:

- hides implementation (not necessarily a con)

##### Questions:

- ...?

## 3.23 Receive policies instead of data

##### Use case:

- you've got a method that's called by multiple clients, and these clients want it to handle edge case(s) in different ways

##### Implementation:

- pass block/Proc as param

##### Pros:

- flexible... can define own policy methods to handle infinite number of cases

##### Cons:

- potential to get hairy w/ multiple/complex policies

##### Questions:

- ZOMG ARE WE FINALLY DONE WITH CHAPTER 3
