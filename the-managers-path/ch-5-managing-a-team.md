# Chapter 5: Managing a Team

This chapter covers the switch from managing a couple people to a full team, which has different technical, strategic, and leadership requirements.

-----

## Staying Technical

- Engineering management is a technical discipline and not just people skills since, even if you stop coding, you still have to be able to guide technical decision making. 
- As an engineering manager, you'll be responsible for:
    - holding people, including senior technical staff, accountable for their decisions
    - making sure technical decisions are generally sound
    - making sure technical decisions have been balanced against the overall context of the team and the business
- Staying technical helps team view you as technically credible
- If you don't stay technical, run the risk of making yourself technically obsolete too early in your career
- Need to stay in code enough to see where bottlenecks and process problems occur
- Need to understand system well enough to be able to help guide what is possible and impossible technically
- If you stop writing code too early in career, run the risk of never achieving sufficient technical savvy to get beyond the role of middle management

## Debugging Dysfunctional Teams

__Not Shipping__
- All teams generally have goals and deliverables even when in research mode so even when not shipping code, there should be goals being met
- It could be that tools and processes make releasing difficult
- Not shipping can mask pain points like poor tooling, heavy manual testing, features that are too large, work that isn't being broken down properly
- Releases can be a point of resource contention, which causes conflicts among team members

__People Drama__
- Both brilliant jerks and team members who stir up people drama need to be dealt with
- To deal with the negative person, must make clean that their behavior has to change -> show clear examples and provide corrective feedback quickly
- Don't let negative people stay in that mindset for long on your team because of the toxic drama that they create for the rest of the team

__Unhappiness from Overwork__
- If driven by instability in production systems -> dedicate 20% of time in planning sessions to system sustainability work ("tech debt")
- If caused by pressing, time-critical release -> act as cheerleader for the team, help with work as much as possible, offer incentives (like dinner for staying late or breakfast for being in early), make it known that there will be break time after the push.
- Crunch periods can be a bonding experience for the team and members will remember where their manager was during that time (involved, in the trenches vs not)
- Learn from crunch periods to prevent them in the future

__Collaboration Problems__
- Can be with the product or design team, another tech team, external stakeholders, etc.
- Have regular touch-bases with appropriate peers to work through collaboration issues
- Gather actionable feedback from team
- Do not undermine your peers in front of your team even if you are frustrated with them, stay positive and supportive of them in public
- If team not collaborating well internally, provide opportunities for them to hang out without it being about work

## Ask The CTO: Managing a Former Peer

- Acknowledge weirdness of the transition
- Be open with them and try to make sure they are honest with you about what is going well and what  isn't
- Might have to shift your previous technical responsibilities to others
- Show team you're committed to helping them succeed

## The Shield

- Shielding teams from distraction is important, but you can't shield them from everything
- Don't shield team so much that they can't see the "why" of what their doing. It helps engineers to have context into the problems they're solving and that involves understanding the consequences of failure
- Having context allows teams to make good decisions about how and where to focus their energy
- Sometimes the shield makes the mistakes of denying that any drama exists in the outside world -> this leads to situations where the team feels like bad things are happening and no one wants to admit it
- Instead of shielding in cases like layoffs in other parts of the company, you should communicate this information in a straightforward, low-emotion way -> this alleviates gossip and neutralizes impact

## How to Drive Good Decisions

As an engineering manager you may only have authority to guide decisions and not dictage them, but you'll still be judged on the outcome of those decisions

__Create a Data-Driven Team Culture__
- Efficiency and technical data points should be used to evaluate decisions on product features and technical changes

__Flex Your Own Product Muscles__
- Treat those that depend on the oucome of your work as customers and take the time to develop customer empathy so you can give your engineers context about their work
- Developing customer empathy will also help you figure out where the tech has the greatest direct impact on your customers and that will guide where you invent engineering effort

__Look into the Future__
- Need to understand product roadmap in order to guide technical roadmap
- Stay up to date on technological developments that might change way your team writes software

__Review Outcomes of Decisions and Projects__
- Discuss whether hypotheses used to motivate projects actually turned out to be true
- Doing this helps you and your team learn from your decisions

__Run Retros for the Process and Day-to-Day__
- Regular process retro has value for detecting patterns and forcing a reckoning with the outcome of decisions
- Some questions to think about:
   - Is the team feeling good about how they get requirements?
   - Do they feel good about the code quality?
- This process helps eng manager learns about how the decisions they make affect the way the team operates day to day

## Conflict Avoider, Conflict Tamer

Having a team that is constantly disagreeing can be dysfunctional, but the solution isn't artificial harmony, which is a trap conflict-avoidant managers fall into. Creating a safe environment for disagreement to work itself out is better than pretending that all disagreement doesn't exist.

__Dos and Don'ts of Managing Conflict__
- Don't rely exclusively on consensus or voting
    - Sometimes you have to make the call and deliver the bad news
- Do set up clear processes to depersonalize decisions
    - If you want to allow for group decision making, make sure the group has clear set of standards they use to evaluate decisions
    - This way people have shared understanding of goals, risks, and questions to answer before decision making
- Don't turn a blind eye to simmering issues
    - Conflict avoidance oftens leads to not address issues until they've gone on for way too long
    - During performance review shouldn't be the first time employee is hearing about ongoing negative issues
- Do address issues without courting drama
    - To understand the difference between letting off steam and a real interpersonal issue ask questions like: Is this an ongoing problem? Is it something you've personally noticed? Is this something many people on the team are struggling with? Is there a power dynamic or potential bias at play?
    - Goal is to identify problems that are causing the team to work less efficiently and not to play therapist
- Don't take it out on other teams
    - Conflict-avoidant managers often seek conflict when it comes to other teams since they identify strongly with their team and will aggressively react to what they perceive as threats from outsiders
- Do remember to be kind.
    - It's more important to be kind than nice
    - It's kind to tell someone who isn't ready for a promotion yet that they aren't ready, but here are the things they can work on to get there.
    - It's unkind to tell someone that they could maybe be promoted and then to watch them fail even if it feels nice to say to them in the moment
- Don't be afraid
    - Some fear is natural, but we can't avoid all conflict because we're afraid of it
- Do get curious
    - Being thoughtful about your actions is the best way to combat fear of conflict
    - Am I pushing this decision to the team because they really are the best people to decide, or am I just afraid that if I make an unpopular but necessary decisions people will be made at me?

## Challenging Situations: Team Cohesion Destroyers

Most cohesive teams have a sense of camaraderie and even if they have other obligations, they aren't excited to escape their teammates everyday. Goal is psychological safety -> a team that's willing to take risks and make mistakes in front of one another, which is why toxic employees are such an issue

__The Brilliant Jerk__
- It's hard to justify getting rid of someone who produces great work even though they're a drain on everyong around them
- Best way to avoid a brilliant jerk is not to hire one
- Dealing with a brilliant jerk requires strong management
- Openly refuse to tolerate bad behavior -> when a person is behaving badly in a way that affects the whole team, say something in the moment to make sure the standard of behavior is clear
- Need to have tight control of own reaction when delivering public feedback on bad behavior since seeming emotional in this case can undermine you. 
- Keep feedback neutral, but to the point
- If the brilliant jerk's behavior only affects you then save feedback for private

__The Noncommunicator__
- This person seems to prefer to work in secret and unveil a project when they're done, doesn't discuss things with teammates, might take their tickets and do the work, doesn't want to go through code review or design review for large projects
- As manager, you have to stop this behavior as early as possible
- If necessary, make it clear that they're not meeting expectations of their work by not communicating
- Try to address root cause of their information hiding -> is it fear of being found lacking? Is it a lack of respect? Do they not feel safe sharing their work in process?
- If team is treating person like an outsider, you have to decide whether to correct team or move individual to another team

__Employee Who Lacks Respect__
- Doesn't respect you as manager or their teammates
- Ask person if they want to be working on your team
- If they do want to work on team, lay out expectations clearly and calmly. If not, start process of moving them to another team/company

## Advanced Project Management

As eng manager you help set schedule for your team. You estimate whether your team can do certain projects, how much work those projects will be, and whether you have the right people to complete the work.

### Project Management Rules of Thumb

__None of this is a replacement for agile project management__: Being responsible for larger picture goals means having to do higher level planning that maybe not completely fit into your team's usual agile process

__10 productive engineering weeks per engineer per quarter__: with Q1 being most productive and Q4 being least productive so plan accordingly.

__Budget 20% of time for generic sustaining engineering work__: this includes testing, debugging, cleaning up legacy code, migrating language or platform versions, and other work. This time can also be used to smooth over unexpected delays in feature development.

__As you approach deadlines, it is your job to say no__: Sometimes to achieve goal you have to cut scope at end of project or present options for what can realistically be implemented

__Use doubling rule for quick estimates, but push for planning time to estimate longer tasks__: off the cuff estimates are hard so doubling an estimate is a good rule when you can't immediately delve into reasons

__Be selective about what you bring to the team to estimate__: distracting and stressful for team to constantly be asked for random project estimates. As eng manager, you're responsible for limiting uncertainty that's presented to the team. Try to get teamwide process in place for talking about new features and customer complaints. Limit estimations that occur outside of process

## Assessing Your Own Exprience
- What are your new responsibilities now that you’re the manager of a team? What tasks have you stopped doing or handed off to someone else in order to make time for these new responsibilities?
- How well do you feel you know the day-to-day challenges of writing, deploying, and supporting code on your team?
- How often does your team mark work as completed?
- When was the last time you wrote a feature, debugged a problem, or paired with a member of your team on some code he or she was struggling with?
- Are there one or two team members who cause the bulk of negativity on the team? What is your plan for getting rid of the problem moving forward?
- Do your team members seem engaged with one another? Do they smile in meetings? Make jokes in chat? Get coffee or lunch together? When was the last time you all sat down together without talking about work?
- How does your team make decisions? Do you have a process for assigning decision-making responsibility? What decisions do you hold yourself responsible for making?
- When was the last time you reviewed a completed project to see if it had achieved its goals?
- How well does your team understand why they are working on the projects they are working on?
- When was the last time you cut scope on a project? What did you use to determine which pieces to cut?
