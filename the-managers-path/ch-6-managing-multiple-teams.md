# The Manager's Path Chapter 6: Managing Multiple Teams

aka L33T mgmt

Managing multiple teams does not necessarily mean managing multiple managers, so book is going to cover these topics separately.

Role where you're managing multiple teams: Director of Engineering.

## Time Management

- Importance vs urgency
- Two things not to cut:
	- Meetings (with your team)
	- 1:1s
	- ^^ These give you first-hand insight into team health

## Delegation

First two paragraphs of this section describe a GRIM reality.

- Simple + Infrequent == do it yourself
- Otherwise, delegate

## Ask the CTO: Team Warning Signs

- Disengagement
- Skipping 1:1s
- Low level of detail
- Low engery
- Shifting tasks/priorities (too beholden to whims of customer)
- Low curiosity

## Challenging Situations

- How to say no?
  - "Yes and"
  	- Not just for improv!
  - Create a policy
  	- Define the cost of saying yes
  	- Stop repeating yourself
  - "Help me help you"
  - Appeal to resourcing (time and budget)
  	- Seems risky?
  	- Don't default to "not right now"
  - Work as a team
  	- Echo and amplify
- Don't say "maybe"


## Measuring Health

- Frequency of releases
- Frequency of commits
- Frequency of incidents

Use these as clues, not metrics to hit.

## Scenario: Us v Them

- "Shallow binding"
	- Cult of the leader (fragile to turnover)
	- Resistance to outside ideas
	- "Empire building"
	- Inflexibility (opposed to change)
- "Purpose-based binding"
  - Resilient to turnover
  - Open to new ideas
  - "First team focused"

# Honing Process

- Signals that process needs fixing:
	- Something that takes too long? (impatience)
	- Something that takes too much effort? (laziness)

## Discussion Questions

1. How does the author's job description for Director of Engineering role compare to our team's?
2. What do folks think about Dir of Eng writing code? Performing code reviews?
3. What are strategies people have used for delegating? What's worked? What hasn't?
4. What strategies for saying no having people used? What's worked? What hasn't?
