### Starting a New Report Relationship

When you first begin managing someone, it is important to get to know the person quickly so you can do your best job in managing them. There are many ways to approach this and many techniques can be used in combination.

1. Buidling Trust & Rapport: One way to kick this off right away is by asking a set of questions meant to help you get to know your report so you can manage them more effectively. Some questions you might consider are:
- How do you like to be praised, in public or in private?
- What is your preferred method of communication for receiving feedback?
- Why did you decide to work here? 
- What are you excited about?
- How do I know when you're in a bad mood or annoyed? Arre there things that put you in a bad mood that I should be aware of?
- Are there any manager behaviors that you know you hate?
- Do you have any clear career goals that I can help you achieve?
- Any surprises since you joing, good or bad, that I should know about?

2. Create a 30/60/90 Plan: This ensures they have some clear goals that will demonstrate if they are learning the right things and getting up to speed. 
- The degee of detail and expectations changes the more senior an individual is.
- This usually requires some work from you and your team to make sure things are well documented and understandable for new hires.

3. Updating the New Hire Documentation: Having a new hire contribute to the onboarding documentation will help make sure it is up to date and as clear as possible.

4. Communicate Your Style and Expecations: Setting expectations helps your new hire to better understand how to succeed in their role. This also helps both of you recognize what you might need to adjust to meet each others' expectations. 

5. Get Feedback from Your New Hire: The first 90 days are a rare opportunity to get a perspective from fresh eyes. It's important, however, to remember their fresh context and take these observations with a grain of salt. It's also crucial to make sure this feedback isn't given in a way that makes the current team feel attacked.
