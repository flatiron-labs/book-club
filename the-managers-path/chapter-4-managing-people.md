### Starting a New Report Relationship

When you first begin managing someone, it is important to get to know the person quickly so you can do your best job in managing them. There are many ways to approach this and many techniques can be used in combination.

__Buidling Trust & Rapport__: One way to kick this off right away is by asking a set of questions meant to help you get to know your report so you can manage them more effectively. Some questions you might consider are:
- How do you like to be praised, in public or in private?
- What is your preferred method of communication for receiving feedback?
- Why did you decide to work here? 
- What are you excited about?
- How do I know when you're in a bad mood or annoyed? Arre there things that put you in a bad mood that I should be aware of?
- Are there any manager behaviors that you know you hate?
- Do you have any clear career goals that I can help you achieve?
- Any surprises since you joing, good or bad, that I should know about?

__Create a 30/60/90 Plan__: This ensures they have some clear goals that will demonstrate if they are learning the right things and getting up to speed. 
- The degee of detail and expectations changes the more senior an individual is.
- This usually requires some work from you and your team to make sure things are well documented and understandable for new hires.

__Updating the New Hire Documentation__: Having a new hire contribute to the onboarding documentation will help make sure it is up to date and as clear as possible.

__Communicate Your Style and Expecations__: Setting expectations helps your new hire to better understand how to succeed in their role. This also helps both of you recognize what you might need to adjust to meet each others' expectations. 

__Get Feedback from Your New Hire__: The first 90 days are a rare opportunity to get a perspective from fresh eyes. It's important, however, to remember their fresh context and take these observations with a grain of salt. It's also crucial to make sure this feedback isn't given in a way that makes the current team feel attacked.

### Communicating with Your Team

> Regular 1:1s are like oil changes; if you skip them, plan to get stranded on the side of the highway at the worst possible time. - Marc Hedlund

Having regular 1:1s is important and most default to scheduling them weekly. It's encouraged to start there and adjust the frequency if it's something that is agreed upon by both parties and makes sense. Meeting less frequently can make it a drag if you miss one and need to reschedule or you might go too long without catching up. 

When adjusting the cadence of your 1:1s, there are some factors to consider:
- How often do you interact with this person offhand during the week?
- How much coaching does this person need?
- How much does this person push information up to you?
- How good is your relationship with this person?
- How stable or unstable arer things in the team and company?

### 1:1 Styles

#### The To-Do List Meeting
In this style, one or both parties come with a list of objectives to cover and they do so by order of importance. This style is efficient and professional and forces you to think before the meeting. On the other hand, it can also feel cold at times and make you wonder why you're not handling status updates async. Make sure you encourage your reports to bring list items that are meaningful. 

#### The Catch-up
This more fluid style is usually driven by your report and gives them the room to bring up whatever they feel is important. The caution here is that if left unchecked, these sessions can turn more into a complaining session or therapy. It's important to resolve (or put aside) workplace problems based on mutual agreement as repeatedly focusing on drama can detract from more valuable efforts. 

#### The Feedback Meeting
Meetings that are devoted to feedback and coaching should be held at regular intervals. Covering these quarterly is a good cadence to give the topic enough attention without feeling like all you talk about is career development. 

If an employee is having performance issues, these meetings should happen more frequently and if you're thinking of firing this person, it's also important to document those meetings and the feedback given.

#### The Progress Report
This usually happens when you're managing managers as it gives you a chance to dive into details around projects you don't have time to dig into yourself. Getting progress reports in this way can be a waste of time so try breaking the habit by asking your report to answer questions outside of their current project or ask them to bring questions regarding the team, company, or anything else.

#### Getting to Know You
It's important to get to know your report as a human being. Without prying, give them the room to talk about their family, friends, hobbies and pets. Also get to know their career so far and their goals for the future.

#### Mix It Up
Switch it up sometimes and go for a walk, get coffee or lunch just to get out of the office. These are best suited for times when you don't have a critical topic to cover because it's less private and it may be easier to forget things if you typically take notes.

### Micromanagement vs. Delegation

This section tells the story of Jane and Sharell.

Jane becomes worried about a deadline and begins to micromanage the project's lead, Sanjay. Jane attends all related meetings, comments on project tickets and eventually takes over day-to-day management of the project. In the end, Sanjay tells Jane he doesn't want to be a tech lead anymore. 

Sharell handles things differently. Sharell worked with Beth, the tech lead on a project, to determine which meeetings to attend and to help Beth understand which details to escalate. Beth leaves the experience feeling confident and ready to take on a bigger project.

Conclusion? Don't be Jane.

More junior members of your team may thrive under detailed oversight but it's important to remember when it's the right time to exercise that level of management. 

Autonomy is an important element of motivation and the reason micromanagers have a hard time retaining good teams. It's important to focus on learning how to delegate effectively. 


#### Practical Advice for Delegation
In the long run, it you don't learn to delegate effectively it can have a negative effect on both your team and yourself personally.


Some tips to help you delegate effectively:
* Use the teams goals to understand which details you should dig into. If a team is making progress against goals, the system is stable and the project manager is happy, there is little reason to dig in. Of course this requires clear goals and expectations to be effective.
* Gather information from the systems before going to your team. It's disruptive and will frustrate your team if you are constantly asking them for information you can find yourself.
* Adjust your focus depending on the stage of projects. Different details are important at different stages and can help you support the team with the right information.
* Establish standards for code and systems. Putting details in place help people think about what is really important while they're creating technology.
* Treat the open sharing of information, good or bad, in a neutral or positive way. Make sure you're helping your team find the right type of information and what kind of delivery is expected.

### A Culture of Continuous Feedback

>Continuous feedback is, more than anything, a commitment to regularly sharing both positive and corrective feedback.


Getting into the habit of paying attention and regularly giving feedback will make is easier for you to recognize and foster talent. 


There are some steps you can take to be great at continuous feedback:
1. Know your people. Having a baseline understanding of an individuals goals, strengths, weakness and current operating level will help you frame your feedback.
2. Observe your people. You can't give feedback if you aren't paying attention! Tip: it doesn't have to be public but you should strive to recognize something about each member of your time every week.
3. Provide lightweight, regular feedback. Start with positive feedback; it's both easier and more fun and helps form that communication path to allow for more readily received corrective guidance in the future. 
*Bonus*: Provide coaching where possible and practical. Coaching-based feedback means engaging in details and forming a partnership with your direct report so you can work together to grow.

### Performance Reviews
The 360 model is a performance review that includes feedback from the individual's manager, their teammates, anyone who reports to them, co-workers they regularly interact with and a self review. As a manager you then gather that feedback and distill the information and feedback for your report. This also gives you both a high level view of what other people think about your direct reports as well as their own perception.


Prioritize these reviews and make sure you have the room to focus. You have the opportunity to make this process more or less valuable depending on how you approach it. 


Writing and Delivering Performance Reviews
* Give yourself enough time, and start early
* Try to account for the whole year (or timeframe since the last one) and not just the most recent work
* Use concrete examples and excerpts from reviews (anonymously)
* Spend plenty of time on accomplishments and strengths
* When it comes down to areas for improvement keep it focused. 
* Avoid big surprises by relying on continuous feedback
* Schedule enough time to discuss the review

### Challenging Situations: Firing Underperformers

> One of the hardest things that any manager must do is fire someone


Whatever the process is at your company, it should begin before any process improvement document is filed with HR and long before the actual act of firing someone. 


Having a record of feedback is important when it comes to firing an employee. If you haven't built that feedback and approached the problem in a detailed and explicit way, you'll be opening yourself up to excuse from your report. These excuses might even believable and leave you in a place where there is no clear path forward.


If the reasons for poor performance are actually more related to onboarding, expectations or team culture it's important to address these issues as well or you will have a difficult time retaining talent on your team.

### Assessing Your Own Experience

Have you given feedback in the last week?

When was the last time you handed out kudos in front of the team? 

When was the last time someone behaved in a way that needed correction? How long did it take you to give corrective feedback? Did you give the feedback in private, or did you do it in public? 

Have you ever been given a performance review that felt like a waste of time? What was it missing that could have made it more valuable? 

What was the most useful piece of performance feedback you ever got? How was it delivered to you? 

Do you know how the process of promoting people works in your company? If not, can you ask someone to walk you through it?
