### Starting a New Report Relationship

When you first begin managing someone, it is important to get to know the person quickly so you can do your best job in managing them. There are many ways to approach this and many techniques can be used in combination.

__Buidling Trust & Rapport__: One way to kick this off right away is by asking a set of questions meant to help you get to know your report so you can manage them more effectively. Some questions you might consider are:
- How do you like to be praised, in public or in private?
- What is your preferred method of communication for receiving feedback?
- Why did you decide to work here? 
- What are you excited about?
- How do I know when you're in a bad mood or annoyed? Arre there things that put you in a bad mood that I should be aware of?
- Are there any manager behaviors that you know you hate?
- Do you have any clear career goals that I can help you achieve?
- Any surprises since you joing, good or bad, that I should know about?

__Create a 30/60/90 Plan__: This ensures they have some clear goals that will demonstrate if they are learning the right things and getting up to speed. 
- The degee of detail and expectations changes the more senior an individual is.
- This usually requires some work from you and your team to make sure things are well documented and understandable for new hires.

__Updating the New Hire Documentation__: Having a new hire contribute to the onboarding documentation will help make sure it is up to date and as clear as possible.

__Communicate Your Style and Expecations__: Setting expectations helps your new hire to better understand how to succeed in their role. This also helps both of you recognize what you might need to adjust to meet each others' expectations. 

__Get Feedback from Your New Hire__: The first 90 days are a rare opportunity to get a perspective from fresh eyes. It's important, however, to remember their fresh context and take these observations with a grain of salt. It's also crucial to make sure this feedback isn't given in a way that makes the current team feel attacked.

### Communicating with Your Team

> Regular 1:1s are like oil changes; if you skip them, plan to get stranded on the side of the highway at the worst possible time. - Marc Hedlund

Having regular 1:1s is important and most default to scheduling them weekly. It's encouraged to start there and adjust the frequency if it's something that is agreed upon by both parties and makes sense. Meeting less frequently can make it a drag if you miss one and need to reschedule or you might go too long without catching up. 

When adjusting the cadence of your 1:1s, there are some factors to consider:
- How often do you interact with this person offhand during the week?
- How much coaching does this person need?
- How much does this person push information up to you?
- How good is your relationship with this person?
- How stable or unstable arer things in the team and company?

### 1:1 Styles

#### The To-Do List Meeting
In this style, one or both parties come with a list of objectives to cover and they do so by order of importance. This style is efficient and professional and forces you to think before the meeting. On the other hand, it can also feel cold at times and make you wonder why you're not handling status updates async. Make sure you encourage your reports to bring list items that are meaningful. 

#### The Catch-up
This more fluid style is usually driven by your report and gives them the room to bring up whatever they feel is important. The caution here is that if left unchecked, these sessions can turn more into a complaining session or therapy. It's important to resolve (or put aside) workplace problems based on mutual agreement as repeatedly focusing on drama can detract from more valuable efforts. 

#### The Feedback Meeting
Meetings that are devoted to feedback and coaching should be held at regular intervals. Covering these quarterly is a good cadence to give the topic enough attention without feeling like all you talk about is career development. 

If an employee is having performance issues, these meetings should happen more frequently and if you're thinking of firing this person, it's also important to document those meetings and the feedback given.

#### The Progress Report
This usually happens when you're managing managers as it gives you a chance to dive into details around projects you don't have time to dig into yourself. Getting progress reports in this way can be a waste of time so try breaking the habit by asking your report to answer questions outside of their current project or ask them to bring questions regarding the team, company, or anything else.

#### Getting to Know You
It's important to get to know your report as a human being. Without prying, give them the room to talk about their family, friends, hobbies and pets. Also get to know their career so far and their goals for the future.

#### Mix It Up
Switch it up sometimes and go for a walk, get coffee or lunch just to get out of the office. These are best suited for times when you don't have a critical topic to cover because it's less private and it may be easier to forget things if you typically take notes.
