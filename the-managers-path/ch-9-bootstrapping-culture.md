Chapter 9 - Bootstrapping Culture

Senior engineering leaders role is set culture

First-time CTOs are not clear and thoughtful about culture.

Culture should be just as important as any other pieces of infrastructure.

Structure/process has a bad rap
- Seen as pointless or harmful
- Surveys called it 'slow' or 'innovation-crushing'

Reframe the discussion
- Structure -> learning
- Process -> transparency
- Systems -> learn from successes and mistakes, share those lessons

>"This learning and sharing is how organizations become more stable and more scalable over time."

To create healthy teams:
- Figure out what's important to you and team
- How to scale the knowledge and effort to whole company
- Set basic theory and test it

Startups attract people who are fine with uncertainty and risk, to get high degree of freedom.

Initial decisions will be undone multiple times, however, core things like vacation policy, core office hours, and company values are within the first few years of the company.

In early startups, almost everyone is a leader.

Most important thing!: Pick a strategy and run with it. Decisiveness against multitude of options. The ability to figure out a solution, fix it, then try something else when it fails.

"You don't need to find the perfect solution..."

The alternative: Limit decisions by punting on decisions. Example: Not having titles. Deciding not to decide.

[The Tyranny of Structurelessness](https://www.jofreeman.com/joreen/tyranny.htm)

Saying the team has no structure hides power structures and then challenges scaling the team.

Unstructuredness can work but under specific circumstances:
- Task oriented to a narrow specific task
- Small and homogeneous group for stream-lined communication
- High degree of communication usually through being colocated and really knowing each other
- Low degree of skill specialization, where people are interchangeable.

Early-stage startups are like this.

Technical decisions and processes often start structureless. Code done to satisfy an immediate task, with no overarching thought.

Structure is how scale, diverisity, and more complex tasks are possible. Strong leaders are capable of identifying and shaping team structures that support goals of the team and individuals.

Structure can come too early and cause harm by slowing everyone down by filtering decisions through a hierarchy.

More common, structure too late. If one person makes all the decisions and changes their mind, in a small group, not much effort is wasted. In a larger group, changes become much more expensive.

Startup leadership: race car -> commercial flight -> spaceship
Total understanding and control, contained risk -> Movements need more consideration but still controlled, more risk due to more people depending on you, however can go further -> Quick moves are impossible, lots of people are in on risk, but possible to go to infinity and beyond!

## Assessing Your Role

Factors to assess the vessel:
- People - More people, needs more structure
- Age - Older company, more entrenched habits.
- Size of infrastructure - Fewer business rules and little digital/physical infrastructure to support, less need for structure
- Risk tolerance - Outside regulation and lots to lose? Needs more structure to limit risk and to pass outside scutiny.

John Gall's Law from *Systemanitcs*:

>A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple system.

Companies started with a simple system with few people. If company is still around and larger, it added people, rules, and systems to evolve into a complex system.

Small teams grow and need to learn from failure.

>...failure is the best place to investigate and identify where your structure needs to change

Example: career ladder. One person quitting due to lack of career path isn't enough to spur structure, however multiple people quitting or not joining can cause change.

Weigh value of lack of structure vs losing people who would help team

Examine failure and the reality that contributed to it. Patterns found there are opportunities to evolve structure.

Structure can be applied in smaller parts of system before applied to whole.

Examine success? Bad teacher.

>...luck plays a role in both failure and success, we often attribute failure to bad luck and success to our own actions

Success can be seen as fix-all and applied to places where it won't work.

Integrating new team members, people leaving company due to no path or growth, production outages due to bad security are all examples of lack of structure that needs to be learned from.

## Creating Your Culture

Culture: generally unspoken shared rules of a community

Culture doesn't mean you need to hold all the same values. It creates overlap and guides interactions. Its the glue that connects the team and allows decisions to be made in uncertainty.

>Not every person will fit in at every company. The sooner you realize this, the better.

Thoughtfully-created values should not be discriminatory.

Not culture: "Engineers who graduated from MIT"
Culture: "People who value technology innovation, hard work, intellect, scientific process, and data"

Difference: much broader set of people fit

How to tell if a person fits in the culture? Usually person does well naturally. Stress or burnout, but well liked and usually happy.
Doesn't fits culture? More friction involved and not well accepted.

## Applying Core Values

As a leader, understanding, cultivating, and setting culture is part of role

1. Define culture
  - Map company values to team
  - Add what your team finds important
  - Subteams will have differences unique to them
2. Reinforce culture through rewards for exhibiting values
  - At all-hands, shoutouts. "keeping it dope"
  - Performance reviews are a time to realign this.
3. Use culture as part of interview
  - Have interviewers look out explicitly for those values
  - Friendship markers "Would you like being stuck in an airport with this person?"
  - Though not about hiring friends.

>The shortcuts you get by hiring friends are not usually the values you need to form a strong team.

Be specific!

## Creating Cultural Policy

Copying an existing doc probably isn't enough.

Engineering ladder flop
- Took collegue's ladder, which started as basic with minimal guidance on leveling, made small changes.
- Big differences in teams
- Diverse backgrounds and experience had no shared cultural habits to fill in the gaps.

## Writing a Career Ladder

- Team participation
  - Get feedback from senior staff. Discuss and get input
- Search for examples
  - Ask for ladders from other companies. Larger companies usually have more detailed ladders.
- Be detailed
  - Inspiration and descriptive but matches reality of expectations
- Both long descriptions and summaries
  - Two version: Side-by-side short form that helps quick comparison. Long form that tells complete story with more details.
- Map ladder to salary
  - Each level will have salary band.
- Provide advancement opportunities
  - More levels towards the beginning of the ladder
  - Promote somone every year for the first 2-3 years (?)
- Early stages should have narrow salary bands
  - More levels and narrow salary bands mean people can be promoted quickly, while pay for similar levels can be closer.
- Few levels should have wide salary bands
  - Salary bands should overlap
  - Engineer $50-100K, Senior Engineer $80-150k
  - Allows for exceptional people who aren't ready for increased responsbilities.
- Consider breakpoints/"up or out" points
  - Early-career roles where people who have not progressed and may be better to leave.
  - "What is the lowest level at which people can sit forever, never getting promoted but also not underperforming?"
- Recognize achievement
  - Super Mario World! Some companies have 'secret' levels
  - Probably better to have some levels be keystone. Celebrate!
- Split management and technical
  - Senior managment is volume-based. Enough managers to handle the team.
  - Not balanced with senior IC roles
- Make people management skills a mid-level requirement
  - Start to exhibit leadership, should probably involve humans and projects.
  - Require managements or mentorship experience
- Years of experience
  - Kind of an artificial barrier, but can be generally helpful in early stages.
- Change and evolve this ladder!
  - It's a living document!
  - Tweak for the kind of roles on the team. Don't focus on infrastructure and leave front-end without details.

## Cross-functional Teams

Evolution of engineering org example: Rent the Runway storefront and warehouse teams

- Cross-functional team (frontend engineers, backend engineers, product manager, designers, data analyst, and customer service rep)
- Delivered good feature, quickly
- Understood goals
- Reduced distinction of tech/product vs rest of org
- Puts together everyone who can deliver a successful project

Conway's Law:
>Organizations which design systemsâ€¦are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations.

Cross-functional teams are an acknowledgement that communication leads to effective product development. It will produce just enough of a system to support the product.

Each pod reported to who they did before, but work within project was determined by pod.

Dedicated infrastructure group. Engineering in pods reserve 20% for oncall, interviewing, and tech debt.

Cross-functional structure will change members' values. Best systems designers or most up-to-date -> Best product sense and have communication.

## Developling Engineering Processes

Creating career ladders, values, team structures is easier than frustration and anger over ambiguity.

## Ask the CTO: Engineering Process

Yikes! No processes. New systems in new languages without consulting people.

Processes are a form of risk management. How hard or rare something needs to happen should help dictate how much process needs to be build up around it.

If goal is to move quickly, less process is needed. Make changes more obvious to team. Make review process quick and smooth.

Lookout for places of hidden risk. Processes should have value even when not followed 100%.

"How well can you sleep at night?"

## Practival Advice: Depersonalize Decision Making

### Code Review
- Make it straightforward and efficient
- Be clear about expectations
- Use linter to set on style issues
- Keep review backlog small

### Outage Postmortem
- Don't point fingers and blame
- Focus on circumstances and context of events
  - Helps detect patterns and focuses on the 'learning' part of review
- Be realistic on takeaways
  - Pick the 1-2 truly high-risk issues; acknowledge those that can be let go for now

### Architecture Review
- Examples questions:
  - New language: How many people are comfortable with it?
  - Existing standards for production?
  - Rollout and training process?
  - New operational considerations?
- Be clear about what changes necessitate an architecture review
- Value of review is the prep for review
- Choose the review board wisely

## Assessing Your Own Experience
- What policies do you have now? What practices? Have you written any of them down yet? When was the last time you revisited them?
- Do you have company values? What are they? How do you recognize them in your team?
- Do you have a career ladder? Do you feel it accurately reflects the team today? Does it reflect the team you want to have in the future? If not, can you improve it?
- What risks are most concerning for your team? For your company? How can you mitigate those risks without burdening your team with unnecessary processes and bureaucracy?
