# Chapter 11, Part 1 - OTP
- OTP is a way to think about concurrency and distribution
- allows you to use concurrency to build state without language features that rely on mutability
- has rich abstraction for supervision and monitoring

## Managing State with Processes
- functional programs are stateless, but we need to be able to manage state

### Counter
- uses concurrency and recursion to manage state
- separates interface from implementation
- uses different abstractions for async and sync server communication

#### Client  
- serves as the API  
- exists only to send messages to the process that does the work
- the interface for our server
- API sends messages:
  - `:inc/dec` to increment/decrement
    - take pids and return a single atom
    - async (send message to server process and don't wait for reply)
  - `:val` to get the counter's value
    - sends request for value of counter
    - waits for response
    - to associate response with request, `make_ref` assigns a unique value
    - send message to counter
      - message is tuple:
        - atom of command
        - pid
        - unique reference
    - `^` means that rather than reassigning reference, we only match tuples with the exact reference
    - no match means process will timeout

#### Server
- recursively loops
- processes a message
- sends the updated state to itself
- Server implements:
  - `start_link` (uses initial state)
    - spawns a process and returns its pid
    - spawned process calls `listen` (private) which listens for messages and processes them
  - `listen` is the counter engine
    - exploits recursion to manage state
    - listens for message and processes it
    - receive clause calls `listen` with updated state
    - tail recursion optimizes to a loop that can run indefinitely
      - cheap process makes it a good state-management strategy

## Building GenServers for OTP
- Erlang OTP library encapsulates this generic server approach our counter uses
- instead of using specific functions, we can use OTP abstractions
- no longer need to set up messages for sync references
  - `GenServer.call` takes care of it
- GenServer module is in control of receive loop
  - provides code upgrading
  - handling of system messages

### GenServer Code
#### Client
- `GenServer.cast` sends async messages (like inc and dec)
  - doesn't return a reply
- `GenServer.call` sends sync messages which return server state

#### Server
- `init`, `handle_call` and `handle_cast`
- `handle_cast` for inc and dec
  - return no reply with new state
- `handle_call` to specify return value
  - `_from` does the `make_ref` work of associating response with request
- `start_link` to start a GenServer
  - give it module name and counter
  - spawns a new process

## Adding Failover / Process Supervision
- supervisor needs to be able to restart each service according to the policies that are best for the application
  - e.g. killing and restarting a db connection
  - the policy decision should not impact the code that uses the db
    - *ISOLATED*
- replace a supervisor process with a supervisor tree
  - configure the policy
  - makes app more fault-tolerant
- Phoenix trusts error reporting to log errors
  - no to handle every possible exception
- automatically restart services in the last good state
  - *SELF-HEALING*

### Adding Counter to Supervision Tree
- `child spec` defines children Elixir app will start
- pass in initial state
- `opts` is policy (supervision strategy)

## Restart Strategies
- tell OTP what should happen if your process crashes
- `permanent` (default)
  - child always restarted
- `temporary`
  - never restarted
  - use if restart unlikely to resolve
- `transient`
  - restarted if terminated abnormally
- options of `max_restarts` and `max_seconds`
  - defaults to 3 restarts in 5 seconds

## Supervision Strategies
- `one for one` (default)
  - one child dies, only restart it

- `one for all`
  - one child dies, restart all child processes
  - use for connected services

- `rest for one`
  - one child dies, restart the those defined after it

## Using Agents
- agent has many of the same benefits as the GenServer
- it is a behind-the-scenes GenServer secret agent
- plenty of customizable options
- five main functions
  - `start_link`: initializes agent
    - pass a function returning the state you want
  - `stop`: stops agent
  - `update`: changes state
    - pass a function taking the current state and returning the new state
  - `get`: retrieves current value
  - `get_and_update`: combines the above two

## Registering Processes
- OTP lets us register a process by name
- named process can be:
  - local to a single node
  - globally visible to all connected nodes
- can send messages to name instead of pid

## OTP and Channels
- build infrastructure with a tree of supervisors
- each node knows how to restart its own services
- *ISOLATED*
- *RELIABLE*
- *STANDING ON THE SHOULDERS OF GIANTS*
